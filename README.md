My collaboration with Vladimir Nabokov

Vladimir Nabokov passed away while in the middle of writing "The Original of Laura". His son Dimitri published his hand-written notes.

This project uses version control to create an open-source writing collaboration with my favorite author, Vladimir Nabokov. Users clone the original cards, currently being added, and then create a branch of their own development of the text. My aim is to have a zoo of exotic literary animals, all from the same ancestor.
